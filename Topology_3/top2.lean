# Open and Closed
Recall that sets included in the topology are called "open" sets, and their complements are "closed."
Since open-ness is preserved under finite intersections and arbitrary unions,
which set operations preserved closedness?

### Interior of a set

One of the most frequent ways to prove a set S is open is to show that all
points in that set are 'interior points,' meaning there is an open set Uₓ contained
in S and containing x for each point x in S.

Here we put in a little bit of work to prove that a set is open iff it equals
its interior. (The following theorems are slightly modified from Mathlib)
-/
-- The interior of a set `S` is the the union of all open subsets of `S`.
def interior (S : Set X) : Set X :=
  ⋃₀ { U | IsOpen U ∧ U ⊆ S }
-- The following theorems from Mathlib may come in handy
#check TopologicalSpace.isOpen_sUnion
#check sUnion_subset
#check subset_sUnion_of_mem

-- The interior of any set is open
theorem isOpen_interior {S : Set X} : IsOpen (interior S) := by
  sorry

-- Any open set in S is also in the interior of S
theorem interior_maximal {S U : Set X} (h₁ : U ⊆ S) (h₂ : IsOpen U) : U ⊆ interior S := by
  sorry

-- If S is open, S is its own interior, and vice versa
theorem interior_eq_iff_isOpen {S : Set X} : interior S = S ↔ IsOpen S := by

### Closure and Boundary of a Set

The closure of a set is somewhat the opposite of the interior; the interior is the
union of all open sets contained within and the closure is the intersection of all
closed sets containing the original set.
As the name implies, the closure of a set is closed.

The boundary of a set is the difference between the closure and interior. In Mathlib,
the boundary of a set is referred to as the frontier.
From here we'll prove some theorems about the closure and boundary of a set.

#check IsOpen.union --useful for binary union of open sets
def closure (S : Set X) : Set X :=
  ⋂₀ {T | IsClosed T ∧ S ⊆ T }

def boundary (S : Set X) : Set X :=
  closure S \ interior S

theorem isClosed_closure {S : Set X} : IsClosed (closure S) := by

    simp [ext_iff]

  -- hint: use the previous theorems from this file

Later, we will investigate the topological property of connectedness. A connected space
has some set not equal to univ or ∅ which is both open and closed, i.e. a set with no boundary.
