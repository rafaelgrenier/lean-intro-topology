# Sets and Functions in LEAN (Pt. 2: Practice)

The following sample problems are pulled from Math in Lean chapter 4, plus a few
of my own making.

--MIL 4.1 Problem #1
example : s ∩ (t ∪ u) = s ∩ t ∪ s ∩ u := by
  sorry

--MIL 4.1 Problem #2
example : s \ (t ∪ u) ⊆ (s \ t) \ u := by
  sorry

--MIL 4.1 Problem #7
example : s \ t ∪ t \ s = (s ∪ t) \ (s ∩ t) := by
  sorry

--MIL 4.1 Problem #11
example : (s ∪ (⋂ i, A i)) = ⋂ i, A i ∪ s := by
  sorry

example: (s ∩ ∅ = ∅) ∧ (s ∪ ∅ = s) := by

--MIL 4.2 Problem #1
example : f '' s ⊆ v ↔ s ⊆ f ⁻¹' v := by
  sorry

example : s ⊆ f ⁻¹' (f '' s) := by
  sorry

--MIL 4.2 Problem #22
theorem Cantor : ∀ f : α → Set α, ¬Surjective f := by

This is a proof that no function mapping a set to ites power set can be surjective.
The idea behind this proof is to construct a subset of the domain (here denoted S) such that
no element from the domain can be mapped to that subset. Try proving the last two blocks!

  intro f surjf
  let S := { i | i ∉ f i }
  rcases surjf S with ⟨j, h⟩
  have h1 : j ∉ f j := by
    intro h'
    have : j ∉ f j := by rwa [h] at h'
    contradiction
  have h2 : j ∈ S := by {sorry}
  have h3 : j ∉ S := by {sorry}
  contradiction
