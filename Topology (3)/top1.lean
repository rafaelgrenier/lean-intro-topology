# Topology in LEAN
For some space X, a topology T is a collection of sets of elements from X satisfying the following:
· univ ∈ T,
· ∅ ∈ T,
· The union of arbitrarily many sets in T is also in T, and
· The intersection of any two sets in T is also in T.
The sets included in the topology are called "open" sets, and their complements are "closed."

class TopologicalSpace (α : Type u) where
  IsOpen : Set α → Prop

  IsOpenInter : ∀ s t, IsOpen s → IsOpen t → IsOpen (s ∩ t)
  IsOpenSetUnion : ∀ s, (∀ t ∈ s, IsOpen t) → IsOpen (⋃₀ s) -- ∅ ∈ T follows from s = ∅

def IsOpen [TopologicalSpace α] : Set α → Prop := TopologicalSpace.IsOpen

Specifying a particular topology is cumbersome to do directly from the above definition, so instead
there are a handful of other means to describe a topology on a space. In this section, we will
discuss two: Bases and Filters.

A basis B for a topology is a collection of sets such that
B covers the entire space and covers the intersection of any two sets in B.
(for any pair of sets in B, there are sets in B which lie within the intersection and cover it)
This notion of a basis yields a topology T whose open sets are all possible unions of basis sets.
You may check for yourself that the properties of a basis guarantee that T will be a topology.

    B₁ ∈ Carrier → B₂ ∈ Carrier → ∀ x ∈ B₁ ∩ B₂, ∃ B₃ ∈ Carrier, x ∈ B₃ ∧ B₃ ⊆ B₁ ∩ B₂
